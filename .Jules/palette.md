## 2025-05-15 - Icon-Only Buttons in Gradio
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like "🎲") in Gradio lack native accessibility features (like aria-label) in this version, making them confusing and inaccessible.
**Action:** Always pair icons with descriptive text (e.g., "🎲 Example") or ensure `info`/tooltip attributes are supported and used.
